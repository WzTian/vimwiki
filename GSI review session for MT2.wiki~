===Ocean Circulation===
===waves===
===wave calculations===
===Tides===
===Coastal Processes===
===esturaries===
===sediments===
turbidity current brings lots of terrigenous sediments far in to the sea.

===Calcium Carbonate Chemistry===
!CaCO3 rules:
- supersaturate everywhere at surface
- occur in seawater Temp > 5 celcius
- ksp stuff....*Note: with pH and Kh, we can calculate the concentration of the (bi)carbonate ions*
- (use logarithm to get `[H+]` from pH, and plug in to calculate)
- CO2 dissolves better at greater Pressure and low temp
- dissolved CO2 increases acidity
- *Note: aragonite dissolve earlier*
- _In atlantic CCD 4km, Pacific CCD <1km(older water, more acidic)_
