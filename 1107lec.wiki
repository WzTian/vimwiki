Two methods of primary production:
- photosynthesis :surface ocean `6CO2+6H2O -> c6h12o6 + 6o2`
- chemosynthesis :deep ocean `co2+02+24h2s -> c6h12o6 + 24s + 18 h2o`

limiting factor: light
- 0~70 meters ehphotic zone 1% light level(shallower in SF bay) photosynthesis can occur
- 70~600 m disphotic zone
- (THe first two are called photic zone)
- 600~bottom Aphotic Zone

limiting nutrients:
- nitrogen: cellular metabolics, proteins
- phosphate: buiding large molecules within the cell
- silicon: Diatons and radiolarians(build the sturctures)
- iron: photosynthesis(limited far from continental sources)

Three loops:
- rapid cycling of nutrients in surface water
- slower in deep water(thermohaline:1400yr)
- slower still if reaches ocean sediments(hundreds of million of years)

Compensation depth :: depth where primary production equals respiration
critical depth :: the depth at which the intergrated primary productivity above that depth equals the integrated respiration above that depth
A phytoplankton bloom occur when the mixing depth shallows.

Plankton :: organisms, usually small, drift with currents
- mostly microscopic
- live in surface ocean
- either primary producers or consumers
