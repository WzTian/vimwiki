typo divergent plate boundary(continent continent) in plate tectonics. 
use a calculater for exam.(non-programable)
The exam only last 50 minutes!begin 6 45 come in at half past six

differential solar heating 
pressure gradient force: put wind in motion.
the Ekman Spiral is caused by coriolis effect( teh net transport is 90 def offset from wind foring.
piles water up in to the center of gyres (few meters high) creates a pressure gradient force
balance the coriolis, stop the water from all come in the center
The center is not in the center of ocean, but since coriolis change with lattitude, more water
pils up in the west in N hemi.(western boundry intensification.
    relates to conservation of potential vortivity in the gyre:
        Q - (f + sigma) /H
            sigma vorticity due to fluid circulation
            f vorticity due to earth rotation, depends on local lattitude

Eddies can last long time.
==== Coastal upwelling ====
caused by north wind
less than 1 percent of the surface of ocean but account for 20% of the worlds fish catch. productive.
nutrients are lifted up

(in North to the right, in SOuth to the left.)convergence cause garbage patch in the center of gyres

==== Equatorial upwelling====
when trade wind cross the equator.

==== el nino la nina====
when read data, it indicates the mean difference.
====== el nino ======
normal: water pile up in the west. 
el nino : warm water go to east pacific. ever 3-7 years 10 in 40 years, defined by abnormal sea temp.
positive ONI >= 0.5 cel
====== la nina ======
colder than avg in east warmer in west,
neg ONI <= -0.5 cel
