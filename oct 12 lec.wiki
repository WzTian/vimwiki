===Review: tides===
# forcing: gravity (externally forced waves)(mainly from the moon)
# wave equation: shallow water wave 
# mixed, semi diurnal(daily)(most locations), diurnal
# level: MLLW(mean lowest low water) MLW(mean low water)
`NOTE: the earth moon system is rotation around the mutual mass center(which is inside earth)`
The gravity of moon and the "centrifugel" force cause the two tides.
NEAP::(sluggish) 
SPRING::()
Tractive force::the sum of the gravitational force and the centrifugle forces
Amphidromic Points::the point at sea whrere there is *NO* tidal effect.
The tides in pacific _rotates_ around the edge of basin counter-clockwise.(water also do this in small bays)
Bay of Fundy: Highest tidal range due to basin resonance.

===COAST===
=====Coast Vs Shore=====
Coast:: where waves/tides influence land including bottom.
shore:: coundary between water and land -this changes over time.
continental margins:passive active
Active margins are generally erosional
rule of thumb::waves start to break when depth is shallower than _wave base_ (distance between crests divded by 2)
