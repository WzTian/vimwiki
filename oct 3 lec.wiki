The volume of the Pt Sur explore is 5 L the bouyancy adjustment is 0.2 L

Conductivity Temperature Depth -->> salinity(based on conductivity) density pressure ...

calcium is a conservative element. It's concentration does not change much
as depth changes. residense time much longer than that of water. 
Elements with varying profiles are NON-conservative.(C N O Si P)
Why are there more 02 and less P Si at 6km?
Thermohaline Deep Ocean Circulation
Density (function of T and S and Pressure)
Potential density(eliminate the Pressure effects)
Water in deep sea moves easily along surfaces oc constant potential density.

The strength of Pycnocline determines whree surface water sinks into the deep wea

4 Heat budget terms:
# Short wave(solar)
# long wave(IR blackbody)
# sensible(due to temperature difference - in or out)
# Latent heat(cooling due to evaporation)

Land heat capacity is ~ 0.2 cal/c
water heat capacity ~ 1 cal/c + water has high latent heat.

The Overtuning circulation happens mainly in the five seas.
In North Atlantic Gyre
Overtuning circulation starts with surface water moving into the Norwegion Sea
Losing heat density increase, sink -->> north atlantic deep water
