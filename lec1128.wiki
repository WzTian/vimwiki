Biological amplification of Toxins(high level of toxin in higher trophic level)
==What is pollution==
pollutant :: sth that interferes with natural biogeochemical processes of organisms
marine pollution :: ocean input of substanceso or energy that changes the quality of the water or affect the physical or biological environment
44% from land 33% airbone from land 12 shipping, spill; 10% ocean dumping
===major marine pollutants===
- plastic
- oil
- sewage
- pestacides
- noise
- temperature
===Thre characterisitics===
# quatity amount of substance
# toxicity amount that cause damage
# persistence length of time that persists
==oil pollution==
===where it comes from===
Six ways oil gets into ocean
- rotines maintenance (No.2)
- accidental spills (No.4)
- natural seeps of oil (No.1)
- oil from land sources (No.3)(cars ...runoff)
- air pollutants (No.5)
- offshroe drilling operations (No.6)
Top 3 worst spill
# arabian gulf/kuwait, persian gulf (jan 19, 1991): 380-520 mil gallon
# deep water horizon 2010 185
# Ixtoc 1 oil well gulf of mexicao 
===how do we clean it===
====Dispersal processes====
evaporation, phtolochemical reaction, bacterial decomposition, dilution
====factors that influence====
type of oil, light or crude
====ways to deal with...====
# disperse, break it down into smaller particles using chemical(some harmful)
# skim, mechanically take oi off surface of the water
# contain mechanically stop oil with booms
# burn,
=====Which is best=====
depend on objectives:
- protect specific region?
- remove oil from surface?
depends on ocean conditions
- calm of windy
- which derection are currents
- *all have tradoffs*
===impacts on wild life===
==plastic pollution==
americans generate 240 lbs of plastice waste per year
===where from===
The burdle :: pertoleum based plastic pellet from with plastic products are derived
===impacts===
entrapment, stragulation, starvation

plastic particles in the ocean adsorb pllutants , concentrating 
them at the surface (inverse sediments)
==Nutrient pollution==
===Where it comes from===
==ocean acidification==
