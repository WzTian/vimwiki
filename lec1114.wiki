==Carbon cycle review==
- organic carbon things were alice
- inorganic , not alive, could be created by alive things(shells)
- particulate vs. Dissolved : is about size/solid, if it passes through a filter, it is dessolved
- DIC dissolved inorganic
- DOC ....  organic
- POC PIC
- DIC <--> POC and PIC(photosynthesis) <--> DOC
==plankton food webs==
===Size===
- pico bacteria, eukaryotic
- nano
- micro
- meso
- macro
- mega jellyfish
 
===Type of organism===
- phyto plant
- zoo animal

====Type of phyto plankton====
- cyanobacteriaa pico,
- cocolithophores : calcareous plates on external, can from great blooms, nanoplankton
- Dinoflagellates: nano, gouped with phytoplankton but some are heteroprophic, red tide, bioluminesence
- Diatoms: micro, 2nd most productive phytoplankton, silica exterior frustule, float through the production of fatty acids and oils, reprouce by splitting into half

====Types of Zooplankton====
- Copepods, holo, micro->meso, most numerous.
- Krill, Euphausiids, meso->macro, holo

===Life history===
- HOlo a life as plankton
- mero larval stage spent as plankton sea urchin,tunicates-phylum chordata(our closest inverterbrate cousin)

===Food Web===
Trophic efficiency: approx 10% between each trophic level (The other 90% go to : waste, metabolism, heat, respiration)

* In open ocean, phytoplankton are small, tropic level => 5 ,productivity: 50,150
* Continental shelves, tropic level 4 , pp: 300 500
* upwelling, tropic level, 3 pp: 500,600
==life in the pelagic surface ocean==
euphotic, disphotic, aphotic.(first two: photic) *zone*

How to avoid sinking: airbubble, flat, small.

How to avoid predation, clarity,diel-vertical migration(from surface to deep, and back: day: depth, night: surface)

==life in deep sea==

17 % below 200m 1% below 3000m

===Little to no light===
- large eye, take advantage of light
- no eye if no light
- bioluminescence
- good sense of smell

===Little food===
- large guts,
- low metabolism, low energy

===High pressure===
- no interal cavities

===Sparse population/interaction===
- permanent mating

===Bioluminescence===
luciferin + O2 --->(luciferase) oxyluciferin + light

Offensive and defensive
===Hydrothermal vents===
Along mid ocean ridges: based on bacterial chemosynthesis
animal(tube worm) here host bacteria.
===Whale Fall===
# mobile scavenger
# enrichment opportunities
# sulphophilic chemosynthetic
# reef
==Key term: Symbiosis==
| type          | host | symbiont |
| mutualism     | +    | +        |
| cmommensalism | 0    | +        |
| prarsitism    | -    | +        |
