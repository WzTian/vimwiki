%title fbterm 


= fbterm =

Tried to make some hacks on vim, ended up installing fbterm on my computer...

added this at the end of my `~/.bashrc`
{{{
    if [ "$TERM" = "linux" ]; then
        alias fbterm="LANG=zh_CN.UTF-8 fbterm"
        fbterm
    fi
}}}

Then I tried to get fcitx-fbterm working. Since I am writting this blog in English, it is pretty obvious that attempt was no success.
When I ran `fbterm -i fcitx-fbterm` in fbterm, I get `stdin is not a interactive shell`. Then I put the IM part in the .bashrc, 
then along with that error, whenever I click `Ctrl-Space`, I get a `unable to autolaunch dbus-daemon without a $DISPLAY set for X11`.
I believe this is all due to my ignorance of the basics. I don't think I have much time to fix this today(or tonight?), if the books cannot
help me, I may have to ask @CSSlayer, hope he is not too busy to answer my rookie quesions...

That aside, fbterm is pretty awesome. I have good display of Chinese characters, and the font rendering is decent. reaction time is good, maybe I 
will try this on my netbook, since the urxvt is still *way too slow*.

I don't understand why people do not like this dark theme, I think it is way more elegant than the original barebone style. Anyway, it is here to stay.
