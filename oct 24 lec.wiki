==Thermodynamic Equilibrium==

Terrigenous:44%
Biogenous:55%
    !CaCO3
    Siliceous(opal)
Hydrogenous:1%
    Formed locally by chemical reactions e.g. Mn nodules
Cosmogenous:
    from outer space

Dust originally takes 50-100 year to sink.
*BUT*:the life feed on zooplankton, and the dust became gecal pellets.(much faster)

Boulders are carried by the icebergs

The turbidity currents of Ganges deliver *large* amount of sediments
An ice age flood carried sediments to the gulf of Mexico
    `Ksp = [Na+]*[Cl-]`
sea water: 39g/L:undersaturated
`Ca^2+^ + CO3^2-^ = CaCo3(s)`
*Note: the concentration of Ca2+ doesn't change over time*
The solubility of !CaCo3 is small, cause solid to form

==Rules==
# Most productions of !CaCo2 shells restricted to water warmer than 5 celsius
# Surface waters are supersaturated everywhere(photosynthesis: `co2+h20<--> ch2o + 02`
# !CaCO3 dissolves when water is below saturation with respect to !CaCO3
# !CaCO3 solubility increases with increasing pressure and decreasing temperature
# REspiration adds CO2 to deep water`CH2O + O2 --> CO2 + H2O` make water acidic
# Sediments loose !CaCo3 when rate of dissolution > rate of supply
# There are two forms of !CaCO3 , calcitc, aragonite(more soluble)
