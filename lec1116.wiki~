==Ecological value==
- small total area < 0.2% of ocean floor
- highest marine diversity per m^2
- as much as 35% of global marine diversity
- at least a million described species
- actual number
===Measuring Biodiversity===
The number, variety, and variability of living organisms in a quantified area.
# species richness: total number of species in an area
# species eveness: how number of individuals in divided among species in an area.area
# disparity: degree of difference between species in an area
# species rarity: the rarity of individual organisms in an area

- Rainforest: most diversity is tied in forest
- Coral reefs: have more phyla represented(32 of 33 animal phyla represented on coral reefs)

==Ecosystem services==
- Fisheries 
    reef fish account for 1/4 of global fish cath
    food and nursery habitat for pelafic fisheries
- protect coast from wave storm damage
- SCUBA tourism
- reef limestone used in construction
- jewelry curio and marine aquarium trade
==Economic value==
*UNDER DEBATE*
==Inherent value==
==What is it?==
===Ahermatypic coral===
- Do not host dinoflagellate symbionts
- do not build reefs
- found all over the worlds's oceans
===Hermatypic coral===
- host dinoflagellate 
- build reefs
- in shallow water
Corals are made of aragonite(sensitive to changes in ocean chemistry)
The coral polyp live in small "cups"

Coral colonies can range from millimeters to meters

==Symbiosis==
Dinoflagellate=symbiodinium(live as symbionts in coral)=zooxanthellae

Symbiosis as a continuum(no distinct difference between mutualism commensalism and parasitism)
symbiosis in coral is mutualism 

CO,,2,, + H,,2,,O + nutrients --> CH,,2,,O + O,,2,,
CH,,2,,O + O,,2,, --> CO,,2,, + H,,2,,O + nutrients + energy

| Host coral                                                      | symbiont: symbiodinium                                      |
| symbiot provides food to host                                   | host provides nutirents to symbiont                         |
| symbiont provides oxygen to host, increasing calcification rate | host provides carbon dioxide to symbiont for photosynthesis |
|                                                                 | host provides protected structure to live in                |

==Where are they==
*TROPICAL ZONE*
===Temperature===
- no in water colder than 18^o^C 
- some can tolerate 40 degree
- optimal range 23-25
===Depth===
- most grow in water less than 25 m
- not more than 70
- light dependent
===Light===
===salinity===
- some can tolerate 42 ppt
- optimal 32 35 ppt
- absent in areas with hight freshwater input
===sedimentation===
- ofeten correlated with freshwater input
- clogs feeding 
===Exposure to air===
- some can live in intertidal zone
- most cannot
==What is reef==
A mound or ridge made of calcium carbonate secreted by corals coralline algae, mollustks, protozoa, and
other organisms
- can live for humdreds of years
- dies, new ones live on the skeleton
- also overgrow other living corals through passive and aggressive means
- The great barrier reef has been growing on and off for 500,000 years (current: 8000years old)

- fringing on shoreline small lagoon
- barrier prallel to shoreline largoon is large and deep continents or islands
- atoll: ringed shaped surrounding a deep lagoon volcanic island only.
