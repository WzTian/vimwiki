Caravaggio: capacity (to depict details (van eyke)) survived in a supressed genre(still life)
(Attention to accidents)(compromise visual capacities)(nolonger sure of the
capacity to know the world)(the time: a time of scepticism, uncertain values, lack of control)
(change happen on the margins...)(seduction, creating desires)(relate the seduction of painting
to interpersonal relationship)(the portable picture (oil painting) vs. fresco)(speculative painting.
(market))(elites' subordination to the underclass)(patronage --> alter piece, big commision)
(meaning resides in the accidental objects relations)

Genre: announciation, audience (context specific)

Mannerism : artists realized that the archievement of Michealangelo (solved realism)
raise the question of what can be further discovered.
