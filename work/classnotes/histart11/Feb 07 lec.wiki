%title Feb 07 Rubens


=Feb 07 Rubens=

- The proximity of artists to the royal power
- The flemish tradition of oil sketch (allow oil painting to take part in large projects)
- sketching as the foundation of Rubens' skill
- How does the unstable substance of oil translates to the representation of power
- think about the situation of the application of paint(viscocity)

*Four philosophers*
    Rubens: a leader of large workshop (international production)
    connected to the _Republic of letters_ ( a class of the educated )
    Serves as a diplomat
    "a philosophical strategy of non-coerced power based of antiquity"
 
The drawing book he made in Rome
    a repertoire of principles of drawing
    trying to consolidate historical representation based on 
    human figures.
    trying to reinvent the principle similar to the sistine
    trying to retrive "the concrete mass of figure" lost in carravagio
    *NOTE* the drawing goes to the edge: no support, backgound.

*Madonna*
    solid object relating to the forms.

NOTE: Rubens is not a fresco painter but a oil painter.  He became a dealer (dealt with purchasing a Carravagio)

1608 (Carravagio died 1610)

*The rasing of cross*
    continue narrative between three pieces
    Oil sketch (Rubens think through oil)
    skin bursting out of the interior (use of tonality)
    Elevaton: diagnal.
    the tradion of oil painting: building up layers of pigments.
    The translucency of oil paint: allow light to penetrate but still resists
    Rubens trys to consider seeing the picture from afar (monumentality)
    neglect the edge
    Sketching on panel: part of old tradition (a model)
    sketch a way to translate into other medium

Entombment
    The hand in Carravagio: the texture of stone confuse with that of body
    The dead body: a surface review the decomposition.
    Carravagio : the resistence of objects: the objects' materiality
    resists our simple categories, resisting the easy "assigning of
    meaning"
    *FLOATING*
    
*Black man*
    the mobility of objects with time
    understand an object in itself

Marie de Mdeici
    a representation of power.
    The allegory of politics.
    At the bottoms, the paint declare itels
    
Titian's Danae
    the viscocity becomes part of th object
    Paint enter into myth.
    
Titian's Diana
    the metamorphysis ( the ambiguity of paint)
    the contradiction

Titian's Marthias
    the myth of civilization
    The absorbtion of objects into the surface
    Oil sketch is about practice on the surface (and destruction)

Rubens: the rape of the daughters...:
    Rape: the physical coertion for the construction of order
    allogory : ambiguity(multiple intepretation)(vulerable)
    The lack of resolution: the depiction of discrete object
    pushed aside for the indeterminacy of boundaries
    (Jewry: the flemish tradion of detail depiction)
    *SUSPENCE* *POWER* *MANIPULATION*

FOr Rubens, paint is the process of metamorphysis itself.
The oil painting contain in itself the threat of dissolution

    Tintoretto: mind the brush strokes
