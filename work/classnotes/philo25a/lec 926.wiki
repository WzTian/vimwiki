=== Republic II ===
    a mixture of conventional socratic dialogue and formal treatise: i.e. traditional socra
    dialogue emphasize on
    "what to do" "definitions" universal characteristic of things.
    Plato is more systmeatic philosopher. to provide s sufficient and positive anwer to 
    "What is F" question.
    he explored all the fields of philosophy. (laid up fundamentals)
    To satisfy the demanding criteria of consistency brought up by Socrates.

He is not satisfied at end of book I for to discuss justice presuppose the knowledge of what
justice is. he"beahve like a glutton..."

To limit the notion of justice to a moore specific definition. 
    three kind of good
        # good for their own sake and for the sake of consequences.(intelligence. health)
        # good for their own sake(pleasure ethetic)
        # good for their consequences.(purely instrumental good)(medicine,)
    socrates put justice in 1st. Gloucon put it in last.
    Goal: to see justice defended as good in itself.
    step to defend injustice:
    # explain what justice is
    # People do justice for the consequences.
    # The life of an unjust person is much better that that of just person.
    
    ----best:to commit injustice---->>>>suffering injustice:worst
    since suffering outweigh commiting, people avoid doing injustice, because the donot have the
    power it takes. Justice is set up to avoid suffering.(The weak who fear suffering is majority)
    commiting injustice is the supreme good, yet requires great power.

    (He prove by a story: invisible ring...)suppose two such ring, one for just person and one
    for unjust --->>> all get corrupted --->>> they behave no way different.
    Justice is rather a social pressure.--->>> justice is not good in itself.

    divide justice and injustice from their respective reputation.
    Justice person: 
        - no external goods
        - no reputation
        - no friend 
        - no favor from god
    He push the conceptions to the extream.
    Adamendas:
        The belief of the media, the education all show that people think justice is 
        just someing good for the consequences.It is never argued that it is good in itself
        even in myth, lengendary, but as the third kind.
        "You agree that justice is 1st good, then praise justice that way"
    
Plato also talk on this matter in other books, showing a will to shake popular myth.
