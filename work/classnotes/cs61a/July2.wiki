===Review on tuples===
Sequence :: an ordered collection of data values
a sequence has a _finite_ length
<br>a sequence has an element for any non-negative integar less than its length
{{{
trip = (1,2,3)
trip[0]
#equivalent to
import operator
operator.getitem(triplet,0)
}}}
{{{
#map function
#note that a new tuple is created.
def map(f,vals):
    result = ()
    for i in vals:
        result = result + (f(i),)
#(f(i),) is a tuple with one element
#since (1) == 1, we use (1,) to represent a tuple
>>> map(square, (1,2,3))
(1,4,9)
}}}
{{{
>>> tuple(range(0,3))
(0,1,2)
# note that range is an object different from tuple
}}}

*Numbers, Booleans, strings tuples ranges* are all _immutable_
<br>"modification" => making an new object
