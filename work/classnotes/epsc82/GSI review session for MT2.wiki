===Ocean Circulation===
Thermohaline circultaion:
    vertical mixing, driven by temp and salinity(density) 
    water sink where there is a weak pycnocline(also sea ice formation --> brines)
    in *SEAs*, the heat prop of land (cold wind)cool the water in the sea, and form deep water
    deep water is more nutritious because the organic matters *SINK*
===waves===
===wave calculations===
===Tides===
===Coastal Processes===
mixing time:: the circulation time, how long does it take a water molecule to travel over the ocean(1500)
residence time:: the time for the ocean to evaporate.
Steady state :: input == output
SF bay: drowned river mouth and tectonic.
well-mixed to salt-wedge change with season.(more fresh water flow in winter)
===esturaries===
===sediments===
turbidity current brings lots of terrigenous sediments far in to the sea.
terrigenous sediments can also be from wind(near sahara)
===Calcium Carbonate Chemistry===
!CaCO3 rules:
- supersaturate everywhere at surface
- occur in seawater Temp > 5 celcius
- ksp stuff....*Note: with pH and Kh, we can calculate the concentration of the (bi)carbonate ions*
- (use logarithm to get `[H+]` from pH, and plug in to calculate)
- CO2 dissolves better at greater Pressure and low temp
- dissolved CO2 increases acidity
- *Note: aragonite dissolve earlier*
- _In atlantic CCD 4km, Pacific CCD <1km(older water, more acidic)_
