-
===mudflat===
along depositional coasts(passive margins)(near rivers /estuaries)
epifauna :: organisms live on the sediment surfacea(or on the surface of other organisms
infauna :: organisms live below sediment surface
===mangrove community===
(mangrove produce *seedlings* )(tropical warm water)
===rocky intertidal===
(along erosional coasts _active margins_
intertidal zonation :: the vertical diestribution of organisms due to the tieds and wave action
adaptation:
# behavioral (snails move with tides)
# physiological
# structural(holdfasts)
===kelp forest===
temperate latitudes in *cold* water
