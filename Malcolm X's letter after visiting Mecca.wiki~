= Malcolm X's letter after visiting Mecca=

Never have I witnessed such sincere hospitality and the overwhelming spirit of true brotherhood as is practiced by people
of all colors and races in this Ancient Holy Land, the home of Abraham, Muhammad, and all the other prophets of the 
Holy Scriptures. For the past week, I have been utterly speechless and spellbound by the graciousness I see displayed all around me
by people _of_ _all_ _colors_.

I have been blessed to visit the Holy City of Mecca. I have made my seven circuits around the Ka'ba, led by a young _Mutawaf_
named Muhammad. I drank water from the well of Zem Zem. I ran seven times back and forth between the hills of Mt. Al-Safa and
Al-Marwah. I have prayed in the ancient city of Mina, and I have prayed on Mt. Arafat.

There were tens of thousands of pilgrims, from all over the world. They were of all colors, from blue-eyed blonds to black-skinned Africans.
But we were all participating in the same ritual, displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in America had led me to believe never
cound exist between the white and the non-white.

America needs to understand Islam, because this is the one religion that erases from its society the race problem. Throughout my travels
in the Muslim world, I have met talked to ,and even eaten with people who in America would have been considered "white"--but the "white"
attitude was removed from their minds by the religion of Islam. I have never before seen sincere and true brotherhood practiced by all colors together, irrespective
of their color.

You may be shocked by these words coming from me. But on this pilgrimage, what I have seen, and experienced, has forced me to _re-arrange_ much of my 
thought-patterns previously held, and to _toss_ _aside_ some of my previous conclusions. This was not too difficult for me. Despite my firm convitions, 
I have been always a man who tries to face facts, and to accept the reality of life as new experience and new knowledge unfolds it.
I have always kept and open mind, which is necessary to the flexibility that must go hand in hand with every form of intelligent search for truth.

During the past eleven days here in the Muslim World, I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass, and slept
in the same bed(or on the same rug)--while praying to the same _God_--with fellow Muslims, whose eyes were the bluest of blue, whose hair was the 
blondest of blond, and whose skin was the whitest of the white. And in the words and in the actions and in the deeds of the "white" Muslims, I felt
the same sincerety that I felt among the black African Muslims of Nigeria, Sudan, and Ghana.

We were truly all the same (brothers)--because their belief in one God had removed the "white" from their _minds_, the "white" from their _behavior_, and
the "white" from their _attitude_.
  
I could see from this, that perhaps if white American could accept the Oneness of God, then perhaps, too, they could accept in _reality_ the Oneness of
Man--and cease to measure, and hinder, and harm others in terms of their "differences" in color.

With racism plaguing America like an incurable cancer, the so-called "Christian" white America heart whould be more receptive to a proven solution
to such a destructive problem. Perhaps it could be in time to save America from imminent disaster--the same destruction brought upon Germany by racism that
eventually destroyed the Germans themselves.

Each hour here in the Holy Land enables me to have greater spiritual insights into what is happening in America between balck and white. The American
Negro never can be blamed for his racial animosities--he is only reacting to four hundred years of the conscious racism of the America whites. But as
racism leads America up the suicide path, I do believe , from the experiences that I have had with them, that the whites of the younger generation,
in the colleges and universities, will see the handwriting on the wall and many of them will turn to the spiritual path of truth--the _only_ way left to America
to wad off the disaster that racism inevitably must lead to.

Never have I been so highly honored. Never have I been made to feel more humble and unworthy. Who would believe the blessings that have been heaped upon an
_American Negro_? A few nights ago, a man who would be called in America a "white" man, a United Nations diplomat, an ambassador, a companion of kings, gave me
his hotel suite, his bed. By this man, His Excellency Prince Faisal, who rules this Holy Land, was made aware of my presence here in Jedda. The very next morning,
Prince Faisal's son, in person, informed me that by the will and dvree of his esteemed father, I was to be a State Guest.

The Deupty Chief of Protocol himself took me before the Hajj Court. His Holiness Sheikh Muhammad Harkon himself okayed my visit to Mecca. His Holiness
gave me two books on Islam, with his personal seal and autograph, and he told me that he prayed that I would be a successful preacher of Islam in
America. A car, a driver, and a guide, have been plaved at my disposal, making it possible for me to travel about this Holy Land almost at will. The government
provides air-conditioned quaters and servants in each city that I visit. Never would I have even thought of dreaming that I would ever be a recipient of such
honors--honors that in America would be bestowed upon a King--not a Negro.

All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all the Worlds.

Sincerely,

El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz
