REview:
Justice in city, each part does its own work.
Three parts of city:
# The producing class
# The guardians
# The rulers.

For individual:
# apetitive part
# spirit part
# rational part

Only if the city is just, one is justified to call it a unified community.
----
Women and Children:

things in city should not be determined by convention or esthetics preference.
but by whether it serves the purpose.
women ( in guardian class should receive the same education.) and be assigned same jobs
Refute: women and men have different qualities.
justification: the differences do not concern the jobs assigned to men.

To maximize the unity of the guardian class:
(sexual, parental communism, as well as social communism) 
Most benefial to the city:
The personal ties and emotional feeling should be utilized to service of the
political unity -->> no private family(children are the children of the class, the generation)
(forms a commitment to the city)

(Optimization of race)Eugene principles: marriages arranged by authorities so that
the guardians think they are given mates based on lot while in fact is is arranged by the authorities.
the lies are compared to drugs prescribed, (as drugs to cure the city)
( a neccesary means towards the good of the city)

There is no differentiation between ( you and your fingers) the city and its citizens.
