== Waves ==

{{{
The thermohaline circulation:
- water sink at poles(little density difference)
- deep spreading
- heated, less dense, goes up
- surface flow
- (determined by measureing the age of water through c-14)
}}}

===Key concepts===
# waves are created by a disturbing force and a restoring force
# waves are disturbances that travel along the ocean surface and transport energy, but *NOT MASS*
# waves behave differently if they are in shallow water or deep water _relative to their own size_.

===definitions===
- crest 波峰
- trough 波谷
- wavelength
- height
- period
- frequency

All waves are *force* by *disturbing force*, *subject* to *restoring force*.

The water molecules move in circles(orbits) at some depth, the circle is too small 

# capillary wave    WL<2cm wind surface tension
# wind wave         WL 60-150m wind gravity
# seiche            large variable, a function os basin size
# seismic sea wave 100 km
# tidal wave 0.5 * radias of earth
(table 10.1)

Three categories of wave:
# deep water waves: depth > length/2
# shallow water wave: depth < 1/20 * length
# intermediate

*deep water waves speed* : C=sqrt(g*L/2*Pi) or C = 1.25*sqrt(L ) C: speed L: WL
*shallow water waves speed* C=sqrt(gd) d: depth or C=sqrt(d ) * 3.1

wind waves and capillary waves can be deep water waves, others are normally shallow water waves
due to their wave length
when wave breaks: bottom moves slower than the peak.
water slow down and bend toward shore.
rogue waves: addtion of waves and opposing currents(max 34m)
