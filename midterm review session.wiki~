SUMMARY:
    essay: do not overdo it. answer concisely,make educated guess when nesscesary.
    ocean and air circu:
        1 uneven distribution of sunlight, solar energy, (change with season)
        2 Pressure gradient: 
            high dens --> high pres ( hot air rise->low p(more water vapor), cold dense->high p)
                air go from high p to low p
            equator: high temp-> low p -> rise air -> sink at 30deg.(Haley cell)
            (ferrel cell polar cell)
        3 Coriolis effect:
            North hemi : to right South hemi: to left.
            cause gyres.
        4 Gyes:
            converge in the center(Note: west wind drift goes clock-wise, while gyes
            in S hemi go counter-c-w.
            Ekman spiral.
            (the sum of the currents on all depth has a direction 90deg to wind.)
    plate tectonics:
        1 how we understand earth?
            layers formed through density difference.:
                solid metallic iron inner core most dense.
                outer core: meta iron nikel liquid flows
                mantel : less dense, solid , flows on long time scales, (2900 km )
                crust: least dense,(less than 100 km) 
                (radius 6300 km of earth.)
                (mantel hot -> rise -> cools -> dense -> desend.)
        2 evidence of continental drift:
            continents seems fit together ,
            mountain ranges that seems continue on diff contin
            fossil evidence.
        3 sea floor spreading evid.
            The earthquake location fit with contin margin.
            radioactive dating.(land much older than ocean rock)
            paleomagnetism(magnetic reverse,when lava cools, it records the magnetic status)
        4 3 types of plate bondaries:
            convergent:the dense plate go underneath the lesser dense(ocean go under land)
            divergent:mid ocean ridges. hot mantel material move up cools up and form new
                crust
            transform:(California)plates moving past each other.
            Note: hot spot not on plate bondary(Hawaii)
    Important bathymetric feature:
        1 continental shelf: long shallow region near land,
        2 contin slope: still on contine  
        3 contin rise: steeper
        4 oceanic plain:
        5 guyot, seamount.
    (Density is IMPORTANT)
    Longitude and Lattitude:
        1 60 nautical miles = 110 km per lattitude degree.
        2 110 km * cos(lattitude) per longtitude.
        3 look fact sheet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        4 residense time = amount in resevoir (km^3)/flux in (or flux out) 
            atm = 10 days 
        5 water has be 4 billion years. 
    Properties of Water:
        1 water molecule is polarized(has bent shape has dipole). form hydrogen bond. 
            evaporate at 100 deg c free 0 c 
            greatest heat capacity except amonia.
            max dense 4deg c(even for salt water): ice has crystal structure, 
                take up  more space.
            can desolve salts.
            avg width 4km deepest 11km
        2 thermocline halocline pycnocline.(LOOK FOR DIAGRAMS IN THE BOOK! IMPORTANT!)
            where the temp, salt, density change the most.
            combination of temp and salt determing density.
            (isopycno ....look up in book)
