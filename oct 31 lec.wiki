=Marine life=

==What is life==
# Homeostasis(control, regulate environment)
# metabolism/energy processing
# growth and development
# heredity and adaptation
# Ability to reproduce
# response to stimuli
# cellular organization


==Life through Time & Evolution==
# 4540 Myrs ago, earth forms
# 4530 Myrs, moon forms
# 4100-3800 Myr "last heavy bombardment"
# 3800 Myr chemical traces life ??(Isotopes: C^12^and C^13^,C^14^:biological process prefer a specific kind)
# 3500 Myr oldes stromatolites
# 3460 Myr micro fossils (Aus)
# 2700 Myr oxygenic cyanobacteria
# 800 Myr first Multi-cellulaar organisms
# 600 Myr first animal
# 0.25 Myr human

Origin of life recipe
Ingredients:
- water
- organic molecules (C-rich)
- proteins + 20 amino acids
- genetic information
- membrane(lipids)

General model of origin of life:
# Reducing Atmosphere(non oxydizing) where electrial activity can catalyze organic molecules (amino acids)
# Phosopholipids can self assmeble into cell membrane
# Protein firs or Nucleic Acid first:
    # 
    # 
    # 
primordial soup

commonalities of scenarios of life formation:
- sort of Concentration mechanism
- sort of energy source to produce organic molecules

Prokaryotic :: non nucleated cell
Eukaryotic :: nucleated cell
 
Evolution:
# more offspring than can survive
# random variation (inheritable)
# some inheritance improve chances of survival
==Primary Productivity==
Def:: The rate of synthesis of organic material in to organic substances (measured in grams C /yr*m^2)
*NOTE* does not equal _biomass_
- photosynthesis
- chemosynthesis(CO2 + H2O + H2S -> C6H12O6 + S + H2O)
