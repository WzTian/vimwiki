The producers
The guardians
    "Harmonious souls: receive the education in term of their feelings and emotions
    So they have a sense of good.
The rulers

Where is justice in the city:
    "THe city has been correctly founded, and therefore completely good, and therefore has
    four virtues: wisdom courage moderation justice.(The cardinal virtues)
    Where are those virtues?
        *wisdom* -->> good judgement (judgement for the good for city as a whole) 
        the vitue of the ruling part of the city
        *courage* -->> correct  belief of what is to be feared.(The laws of the city determines
        the "correctness" the belief.(would not mind dying) the virtues of teh guardians. 
        (_overcoming_ the *fear*, aquired opinion during education)
        *moderation* -->> NOt only about who should rule, but also the agreement the consent
        in the majority.Assigned to all parts of the city to create harmony.
        The largest and the inferior part to consent that they are ruled by others.
        *justice* -->> not Assigned to specific parts. Each parts of city performing its task.
        _injustice_ -->> inferior class rule. 
The amputation of principle of opposites:
    The same thing will not be willing to undergo opposite things at one time. if such were observed
    There exits more than one parts.(different parts of body move differently, so they are differently parts
    
Desires: the way we feel drive to something or opposite
Thirst : desire for water ...etc
So, there is *appetitive* parts of the soul.
Since appetite can be controled, (contradicted by rationality)
So, there is a distinct part for *rationality*.(the nacrophilia example: conflict of desire 
and rationality', the anger is not rational, there fore the spirit part is seperate)
spirit allies with reason in the _civil_ _war_ within the soul.
justice in individual: each part of soul perform its own part.
a just soul is unitarium soul
